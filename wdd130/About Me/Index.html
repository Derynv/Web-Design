    <p>Hi. </p>
    <p> My name is Deryn Venski. I am from Krugersdorp, South Africa.</p>
    <p> My major is Business Management, but I am hoping to get my Masters in Religious Education from BYU-Provo once I am done with my current course. </p>
    <p> I have worked for many years as a support consultant and a software implementation specialist, even though this was more than 15 years ago. More recently I worked in Payroll and Human Resources and as a Compliance Officer. I have been a Facilitator/Lecturerer in many business related courses for the majority of my career.</p>
    <p> I am a lifelong learner and have eight Diplomas in various business-related fields. (A Diploma in South Africa is the equivalent of an Associates Degree in the U.S.) My oldest is a diploma in Computer Data Processing, which is basically a business programming diploma. This is mostly outdated as I am qualified in BASIC, COBOL, and RPG – all programming languages seldom used today, if at all. I'm doing this course to broaden my horisons and have a better understanding of web design so that I can create better looking websites for my businesses.</p>
    <p> I am married for the second time and have three children from my first marriage and four stepchildren from my second (and last) marriage. I also have five grandchildren.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the church for nearly 38 years. I served as a missionary in the Cape Town, South Africa Mission under President J. Richard Clark. My wife and I are currently serving our second Pathway Missions.</p>
    <p> That’s me in a nutshell.</p>
